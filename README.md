Prior to creating this github repository, this project was started on August 11, 2020.
I started this project not knowing how to program at all, and the progress and continuation of this project
is a monument to how far I've come. For that reason among others, I'd like to see this finished.

Currently, I am rewriting the game's scripts and applying new organization to fix old problems. As of 4/17/2024,
the actual in-game scripts are around 1 and a half years old and no longer function predictably. Hopefully this new
structure will be installed within the next year.

This is not a small project. Alongside the programming required, this project is intended to contain over 10 finished
game worlds, with complicated level paths within each. For more details, consult the discord or anyone involved with the project.

Thank you for your attention! I hope to show more progress here soon.
